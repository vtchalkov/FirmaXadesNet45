XadesXmlSignature library
=============

Introduction
-------------
XadesXmlSignature is a Xades implementation based on FirmaXadesNet made by the Department of New Technologies of the Department of Urbanism of the City of Cartagena, which was based on a modification of the XAdES starter kit by Microsoft France.

Important: This library does not implement all Xades standards. The implemented standards have issues. Use this at your own risk.

This fork is for a .NET Standard 2.0 library for Xades signatures of XML documents.
It inherits the features of FirmaXadesNet (see https://github.com/ctt-gob-es/FirmaXadesNet45) and will evolve in the future.
The priority of this project is low.

The license for this library is LGPL (inherited from FirmaXadesNet).
